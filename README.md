## Introduction
A data analytics project exploring sales performance, customer behavior, and profitability using the Superstore dataset. This project showcases end-to-end analytics skills — from data cleaning in Excel to dashboard development in Power BI.

## What This Project Covers

🧼 Data Cleaning (Excel): Standardized data, fixed errors, removed duplicates, and prepared a clean dataset for analysis.
📊 Power BI Dashboard: Interactive visuals showing sales trends, top products, categories, regions, and customer insights.
📈 Key Business Insights: Identifies best-selling products, peak sales months, most profitable categories, and high-performing regions.

## Project Objectives

* Identify top 5 best-selling products and revenue drivers.
* Analyze monthly and seasonal sales trends.
* Compare revenue performance across categories and regions.
* Understand customer buying behaviors for better targeting.

## Key Insights
1. Organizational supplies lead in sales volume, reflecting strong demand for essential office consumables. Top items are Staples (215 units), Binder Clips (179 units), Faxes (158 units), Staples in miscellaneous colors (154 units), and Storex Dura Pro Binders (152 units).
2. Sales significantly peak in December, suggesting the highest revenue generation occurs at the end of the calendar year.
3. The West region tops revenue at $694K, just ahead of the East ($679K), with Central ($501K) and South ($391K) trailing by $193K and $303K, respectively.
4. Technology outperforms other categories, generating $836K—nearly $95K more than Furniture ($742K) and $117K more than Office Supplies ($719K).
5. Staples tops in units sold, but the real profit drivers are high-value tech and office equipment—led by the Canon imageCLASS Copier ($25.2K), Fellowes PB500 Punch ($7.7K), HP LaserJet Printer ($7K), Canon PC1060 Copier ($6K), and Cisco IP Phone ($5.7K).
6. Consumers dominate the customer base, placing 5,191 orders—almost half of all orders—followed by Corporate (3,020) and Home Office (1,783).
7. Binders face steep discounts (37.3%), turning them unprofitable. Aggressive discounting here risks eroding overall store profits.

## Recommendations
1.	Review Binder discounting: bundle with high-margin items or limit to short-term promotions to protect profitability.
2.	Maximize Capitalization on the December Sales Peak: prioritize Q4 resources on high-margin Technology products to fully capitalize on the year-end sales surge.
3.	Invest Strategically in Underperforming Regions: drive growth in Central and South regions through focused marketing, tailored inventory, and stronger local management to balance nationwide revenue.
4.	Establish a Tiered Consumer Loyalty Program: launch a tiered loyalty program for Consumers, offering spend-based perks like early access, exclusive discounts, and free/expedited shipping to boost repeat purchases and CLV.
5.	Implement a High-Value Cross-Selling Initiative: cross-sell high-margin Technology products with Office Supplies at checkout and via sales teams to drive profit growth.
6.	Conduct a Mix/Pricing Audit for Office Supplies: review Office Supplies pricing to raise revenue via small price hikes on inelastic items like Staples, maintaining high sales volume.
